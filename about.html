    <h2 id="h2">About CipherHack</h1>
    <p>
        CipherHack is an educational tool where learners can analyze how text is encrypted with a Vigenère cipher. Users can observe character frequencies and make assumptions in order to determine the encryption key within 10 guess.

    <h2>Vigenère Cipher</h1>
    <p>The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword.
        It employs a form of polyalphabetic substitution. 
        First described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in 1553, the cipher is easy to understand and implement, but it resisted all attempts to break it until 1863, three centuries later.<br>
        <br>
        This earned it the description le chiffrage
        indéchiffrable (French for 'the indecipherable cipher'). Many people have tried to implement encryption schemes that are essentially Vigenère ciphers. In 1863, Friedrich Kasiski was the first to publish a general method of deciphering Vigenère ciphers.
        In the 19th century, the scheme was misattributed to Blaise de Vigenère (1523–1596) and so acquired its present name.

    <h2>How It Works</h1>
    <p>The Vigenère cipher works in a similar way as the rotation cipher, but uses a phrase to vary the rotation based on that characters position from A.
        By doing this it essentially is using multiple rotation ciphers throughout the text.<br>
